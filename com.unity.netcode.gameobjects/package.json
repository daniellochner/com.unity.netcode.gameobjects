    "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Added editor only check prior to entering into play mode if the currently open and active scene is in the build list and if not displays a dialog box asking the user if they would like to automatically add it prior to entering into play mode. (#1828)\n- Added `UnityTransport` implementation and `com.unity.transport` package dependency (#1823)\n- Added `NetworkVariableWritePermission` to `NetworkVariableBase` and implemented `Owner` client writable netvars. (#1762)\n- `UnityTransport` settings can now be set programmatically. (#1845)\n- `FastBufferWriter` and Reader IsInitialized property. (#1859)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Updated `UnityTransport` dependency on `com.unity.transport` to 1.0.0 (#1849)\n\n### Removed\n\n- Removed `SnapshotSystem` (#1852)\n- Removed `com.unity.modules.animation`, `com.unity.modules.physics` and `com.unity.modules.physics2d` dependencies from the package (#1812)\n- Removed `com.unity.collections` dependency from the package (#1849)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed in-scene placed NetworkObjects not being found/ignored after a client disconnects and then reconnects. (#1850)\n- Fixed issue where `UnityTransport` send queues were not flushed when calling `DisconnectLocalClient` or `DisconnectRemoteClient`. (#1847)\n- Fixed NetworkBehaviour dependency verification check for an existing NetworkObject not searching from root parent transform relative GameObject. (#1841)\n- Fixed issue where entries were not being removed from the NetworkSpawnManager.OwnershipToObjectsTable. (#1838)\n- Fixed ClientRpcs would always send to all connected clients by default as opposed to only sending to the NetworkObject's Observers list by default. (#1836)\n- Fixed clarity for NetworkSceneManager client side notification when it receives a scene hash value that does not exist in its local hash table. (#1828)\n- Fixed client throws a key not found exception when it times out using UNet or UTP. (#1821)\n- Fixed network variable updates are no longer limited to 32,768 bytes when NetworkConfig.EnsureNetworkVariableLengthSafety is enabled. The limits are now determined by what the transport can send in a message. (#1811)\n- Fixed in-scene NetworkObjects get destroyed if a client fails to connect and shuts down the NetworkManager. (#1809)\n- Fixed user never being notified in the editor that a NetworkBehaviour requires a NetworkObject to function properly. (#1808)\n- Fixed PlayerObjects and dynamically spawned NetworkObjects not being added to the NetworkClient's OwnedObjects (#1801)\n- Fixed issue where NetworkManager would continue starting even if the NetworkTransport selected failed. (#1780)\n- Fixed issue when spawning new player if an already existing player exists it does not remove IsPlayer from the previous player (#1779)\n- Fixed lack of notification that NetworkManager and NetworkObject cannot be added to the same GameObject with in-editor notifications (#1777)\n- Fixed parenting warning printing for false positives (#1855)"
